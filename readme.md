## Article Scraper

This is an article scraper application that scrapes from my personal website and displays the articles on the main blog page. Users can click the scrape button to see if new articles are available, save the articles to the saved articles page, delete the articles from the saved articles page, and leave comments on the saved articles. All of this data is stored in a MongoDB database.
